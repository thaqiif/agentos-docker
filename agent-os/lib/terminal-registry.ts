/**
 * Terminal registry.
 *
 * tmux stays the source of truth for what is *running*. This module adds
 * the one thing tmux cannot tell us: that a terminal exists at all after
 * its session has been killed.
 *
 * Without it, killing the last tmux session made the terminal disappear
 * from the sidebar with no way to get it back. Now the entry survives,
 * marked not-alive, and selecting it starts tmux again in the same working
 * directory under the same name.
 *
 * A terminal is forgotten only when the user explicitly closes it. Anything
 * else — a crash, a reboot, `tmux kill-server` — leaves it restartable.
