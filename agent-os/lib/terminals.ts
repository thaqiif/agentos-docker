/**
 * Terminals.
 *
 * A terminal is backed by tmux, and tmux is the only place its existence is
 * recorded. There used to be a `sessions` row mirroring each one, which
 * meant two sources of truth that drifted whenever a terminal was started
 * outside the app, killed from the CLI, or lost during a server restart.
 *
 * Provider detection reads the running process rather than the tmux name. A
 * terminal called `shell-b7d16e2d-…` may well have Claude running in
 * it — that is the normal case now that terminals start as plain shells and
 * the user picks their harness by typing its name — so a name prefix says
 * nothing useful. `pane_current_command` says what is actually running,
 * right now, and updates by itself when the user starts or quits a CLI.
